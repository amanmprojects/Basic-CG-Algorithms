# Basic-CG-Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of basic computer graphics algorithms implemented in C. These fundamental algorithms are commonly used in graphics programming and include:

* Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Line Drawing Algorithm
* Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
* Midpoint Circle Algorithm
* Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm
* And more...

These algorithms have been developed as part of the Computer Graphics subject in my B.E. Each algorithm is accompanied by well-commented source code to help with understanding the implementation details. This repository is intended for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning the basics of computer graphics using C.
